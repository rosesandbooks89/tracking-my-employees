## Struggles and Sources
I had a few issues with this assignment. I was able to piece together the code using my tutor and asking askBCS and my classmates but mostly I referred back to the weeks assignments and the class activities. I also used the following sites for help:
* [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)

The first problem I ran into was getting my index file to run in the console. When running node index.js got errors. Working with my tutor I found minor typos and errors within my seeds schema and seeds file. 
The next problem I ran into was that i was getting errors when sourcing my seed file, I was able to fix this by seeing that I had assigned the wrong department id to my employees because I only had 4 departments but I had assigned numbers 5 and above.
